This is the beginnig of a small home library project where I can log my books with titles, author(s), ratings, and reviews. I got the idea for this project from a Reddit user in the /learnpython subReddit.

The code contained in this project is an updated version of that which I made during my ChatGPT Python course. You can access it in the beginner section below. I built this from scratch on my own so I'm particularly proud of it.

The script works as intended now in the command line, so my intention now is to build upon it. My goal is to turn it into a Discord bot hosted on a server, so the script will need to be updated significantly to allow this. In addition, I want to bring the library database out of a server json file and store it in Google Sheets. These changes will test my skills, help me develop, and allow me to manage my home library on the go. 

Star the project to follow its journey, or fork the project and make it your own. Whilst a shoutout would be nice, you have full creative licence to use it as you wish.
