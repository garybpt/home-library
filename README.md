This is the beginnig of a small home library project where I can log my books with titles, author(s), ratings, and reviews. I got the idea for this project from a Reddit user in the /learnpython subReddit.

The code contained in this project is an updated version of that which I made during my ChatGPT Python course. You can access it the beginner section below. I built this from scratch on my own so I'm particularly proud of it.

Once I have the script working in the command line my intention is to host this library on my Discord server as a personal bot so platform-specific updates will be made in due course. I'll then be able to access, update, and administer my library from whenever and weherever I need. 

Star the project to follow its journey, or fork the project and make it your own. Whilst a shoutout would be nice, you have full creative licence to use it as you wish.
